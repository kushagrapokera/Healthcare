# üß† AI-Driven Early Detection of Autism in Toddlers Using Multimodal Data

This project is a proof-of-concept pipeline for the **early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in toddlers**, utilizing AI and non-invasive, multimodal data. It focuses on identifying early behavioral signs through structured clinical inputs, image analysis, and NLP-driven textual trait extraction.

## üìå Project Overview

Early diagnosis of ASD is crucial for timely intervention. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze:

* **Structured clinical and behavioral data**
* **Visual data** (images showing behavioral cues)
* **Textual data** (clinical context, symptom traits)

The goal is to automate and improve the autism screening process by identifying subtle early signs observable in toddlers.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Components

### 1. **üßæ Feature Identification (Structured Data)**

* **Goal:** Identify clinical and behavioral features indicative of autism.
* **Method:**

  * Uses standardized screening data (e.g., Q-CHAT, A1‚ÄìA10 binary indicators).
  * Extracts key behaviors like reduced eye contact, repetitive actions, delayed response.
* **Code:** `Code.ipynb`, `Code-Copy1.ipynb`

---

### 2. **üñºÔ∏è Repetitive Behavior Detection (Image Data)**

* **Goal:** Detect repetitive motor behaviors (e.g., hand flapping, rocking).
* **Method:**

  * A CNN model is trained on labeled images of autistic vs. non-autistic toddlers.
  * Architecture includes convolutional, pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers.
* **Code:** `CNN_model.ipynb`

---

### 3. **üìö Social Reciprocity Assessment (Textual Data)**

* **Goal:** Analyze deficits in social interaction using clinical text.
* **Method:**

  * A BERT-based NLP model performs question-answering on medical descriptions.
  * Extracts indicators like poor eye contact, non-responsiveness to name, etc.
* **Code:** `NLP.ipynb`
